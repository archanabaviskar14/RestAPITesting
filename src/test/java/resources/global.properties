#you should not hardcode the baseurl as it is the common property whole across the framework
#so we will create 1 common properties file so that all the test cases can pull up the baseurl from that
#In java there is a properties class which can extract value from the file if it has .properties extension
#All the framework will take up baseurl from global.properties file so tomarrow
#if url ll change then we can easily update it on 1 single place and it ll reflect on all files of framework
#bcz everytime we will run our test cases on different environment
#like rahulshettyuqa.com or rahulshettyuda.com means fake url for testing
